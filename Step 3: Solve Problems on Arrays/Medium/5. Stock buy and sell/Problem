Problem Statement:

The cost of stock on each day is given in an array A[] of size N. 
Find all the days on which you buy and sell the stock so that in between those days your profit is maximum.

Note: Output format is as follows - (buy_day sell_day) (buy_day sell_day)
For each input, the output should be in a single line.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
A[] = { 100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695 }

Output:
(0 3) (4 6)

Explanation 1:
We can buy stock on day 0, 
and sell it on 3rd day, 
which will give us maximum profit.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
A[] = {23, 13, 25, 29, 33, 19, 34, 45, 65, 67}

Output:
(1 4) (5 9)
