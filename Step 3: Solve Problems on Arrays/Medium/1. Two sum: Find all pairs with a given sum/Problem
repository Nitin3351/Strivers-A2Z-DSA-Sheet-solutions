Problem Statement: 

Given two unsorted arrays A of size N and B of size M of distinct elements, the task is to find all pairs from both arrays whose sum is equal to X.

 
Example 1:

Input:
A[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
B[] = {5, 6, 3, 4, 8} 
X = 9 
Output: 
1 8
4 5 
5 4
Explanation:
(1, 8), (4, 5), (5, 4) are the
pairs which sum to 9.

Example 2:
Input:
A[] = {-1, -2, 4, -6, 5, 7}
B[] = {6, 3, 4, 0} 
X = 8 
Output:
4 4 
5 3
