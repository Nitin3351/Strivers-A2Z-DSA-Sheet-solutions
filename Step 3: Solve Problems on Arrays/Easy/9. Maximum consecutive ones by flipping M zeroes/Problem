Problem Statement: Given a binary array arr of size N and an integer M. Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's produced by flipping at most M 0's.
 
Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1, 0, 1}
M = 1
Output:
3
Explanation:
Maximum subarray is of size 3
which can be made subarray of all 1 after
flipping two zeros to 1.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 11
arr[] = {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
M = 2
Output:
8
Explanation:
Maximum subarray is of size 8
which can be made subarray of all 1 after
flipping two zeros to 1.
