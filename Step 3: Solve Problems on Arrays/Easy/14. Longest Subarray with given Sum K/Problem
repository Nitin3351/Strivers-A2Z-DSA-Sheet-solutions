Problem Statement: Given an array and a sum k, we need to print the length of the longest subarray that sums to k.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
arr = {7,1,6,0}, k = 7

Output: Length of the longest subarray with sum K is 3
Explanation:
 1 + 6 + 0 = 7, it is the longest subarray with sum 7 and length 3.

Example 2:
Input: 
arr = {2,3,5,1,9}, k = 10
Output: Length of the longest subarray with sum K is 3
Explanation: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10, it is the longest subarray with sum 10 and length 3
